# **Crime Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **Crime Data Analysis** using **Microsoft Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing crime trends, hotspots, and patterns. The dashboard provides insights into crime frequency, locations, and time-based trends to assist law enforcement and policymakers in data-driven decision-making.  

## 📊 Features  
- **📂 Data Processing & Cleaning**: Imported and cleaned crime datasets for accurate analysis.  
- **📈 Interactive Dashboard**: Designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard for real-time insights.  
- **📅 Temporal Analysis**: Analyzed crime trends by year, month, and day to identify high-risk periods.  
- **📍 Geospatial Mapping**: Visualized crime hotspots using Power BI's mapping tools.  
- **📊 Crime Type Analysis**: Categorized different crime types to understand frequency and severity.  
- **📉 Trend Analysis**: Used charts and graphs to highlight crime patterns over time.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation  
- **Excel/CSV** – Data storage and preprocessing  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For advanced calculations in Power BI
